This section of the guide will walk through creating a simple SwimOS server application that stores the state of a single i32 value in an agent and interacting with it using a client application.

# Agents

In SwimOS, a Web Agent is a structural representation of an entity that lives amongst your streaming data. It continuously consumes updates of synced state and for each update, it computes new state that automatically gets synced to listeners. These Web Agents contain Lanes which store your state and provide access to it through an address known as a lane URI.

In SwimOS, there are two points of addressability: an agent URI and a lane URI. These are loosly analogous to a database row and column; where the row is the item of data (Web Agent) and the column is the field (lane). Agent URIs may be static (where only one will exist) or dynamic (potentially unbounded); these are covered in more detail later in this guide. This fine-grained addressability allows you to update state and receive updates for only the data that you are interested in.

Web Agents are declared by defining a struct and adding lanes which represent the state. For this guide, an i32 is stored in a lane which holds scalar types, a `ValueLane`. Replace the contents of `tutorial_server/src/main.rs` with the following:

```rust
use swimos::agent::{lifecycle, projections, lanes::ValueLane, AgentLaneModel};

#[derive(AgentLaneModel)]
#[projections]
pub struct ExampleAgent {
    state: ValueLane<i32>,
}

#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct ExampleLifecycle;

#[lifecycle(ExampleAgent)]
impl ExampleLifecycle {

}
```

Lets go over the block of code above.

```rust
#[derive(AgentLaneModel)]
```

The `#[derive(AgentLaneModel)]` macro derives a descriptor of the agent so the agent's runtime is aware of its lane URIs, whether they are transient, how to route messages to each lane and the agent's constructor; a Web Agent may only contain SwimOS core types such as the `ValueLane` above.

```rust
#[projections]
```

`#[projections]` declares a mapping from the agent to each lane within the agent; for the example above, this is: `fn(&ExampleAgent) -> &ValueLane<i32>`. These projections are required when an agent or lane handler is used to perform an action such as updating the state of a lane; handlers are covered later in this guide.

```rust
state: ValueLane<i32>
```

This declares a single Value Lane which stores the state of an `i32` instance where the initial state of the lane will be `i32::default()`. The URI of the lane defaults to the name of the field in the struct but it is possible to override this by applying a field-level attribute of `#[lane(name = "new_name")]`; all URIs must be unique within the agent. Declaring the agent URI is covered later in this guide.

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct ExampleLifecycle;

#[lifecycle(ExampleAgent)]
impl ExampleLifecycle {

}
```

Every agent has a lifecycle associated with it and here one is declared and `ExampleLifecycle`'s implementation is bound to the `ExampleAgent`. While an empty lifecycle has been declared, it is possible to add functions which will be invoked throughout the lifecycle of the agent, such as when the agent starts, a lane receives an update, as well as many other events; one is added later in this guide.

# Server

Now that the `ExampleAgent` has been declared, a SwimOS Server needs to be built and the agent must be registered along with its URI. Two URI formats are available:

- Static: such as `"/example"`. If a static path is used, only one agent will ever exist at that address.
- Dynamic: such as `"/example/:id"`. For each unique address, a new agent will be instantiated.

For this guide, a dynamic route of `"/example/:id"` will be used.

Append the following to `tutorial_server/src/main.rs`:

```rust
use std::{error::Error, time::Duration};
use swimos::{
    agent::agent_model::AgentModel,
    route::RoutePattern,
    server::{ServerBuilder, ServerHandle, Server},
};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync>> {
    // Create a dynamic route for our agents.
    let route = RoutePattern::parse_str("/example/:id")?;
    // Create an agent model which contains the factory for creating the agent as well
    // as the lifecycle which will be run.
    let agent = AgentModel::new(ExampleAgent::default, ExampleLifecycle.into_lifecycle());

    // Create a server builder.
    let server = ServerBuilder::with_plane_name("Plane")
        // Bind to port 8080
        .set_bind_addr("127.0.0.1:8080".parse().unwrap())
        // For this guide, ensure agents timeout fairly quickly.
        // An agent will timeout after they have received no new updates
        // for this configured period of time.
        .update_config(|config| {
            config.agent_runtime.inactive_timeout = Duration::from_secs(20);
        })
        // Register the agent against the route.
        .add_route(route, agent)
        .build()
        // Building the server may fail if many routes are registered and some
        // are ambiguous.
        .await?;

    // Run the server. A tuple of the server's runtime
    // future and a handle to the runtime is returned.
    let (task, handle) = server.run();
    // Watch for ctrl+c signals
    let shutdown = manage_handle(handle);

    // Join on the server and ctrl+c futures.
    let (_, result) = tokio::join!(shutdown, task);

    result?;
    println!("Server stopped successfully.");
    Ok(())
}

// Utility function for awaiting a stop signal in the terminal.
async fn manage_handle(mut handle: ServerHandle) {
    tokio::signal::ctrl_c()
        .await
        .expect("Failed to register interrupt handler.");

    println!("Stopping server.");
    handle.stop();
}
```

You can now run the SwimOS server application:

```shell
$ cd tutorial_server
$ cargo run
```

At this point, nothing will be seen in the console output as the server is listening for events and none are being produced.

# Interacting with the server

In this section of the tutorial, a SwimOS client will be created which will both produce events and consume them from the server.

Create a new client project named `tutorial_client`:

```shell
cargo new tutorial_client --bin
```

Add the dependencies to `tutorial_client/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
swimos_client = "{{ site.data.rust.swimos-client-version }}"
tokio = { "{{ site.data.rust.tokio-version }}", features = ["full"] }
```

To interact with the state of a lane using a SwimOS client, Downlinks are used. Downlinks are bidirectionally-streaming, persistent subscriptions to lanes which provide the ability to update the state of a lane and to receive state notification changes.

Replace the contents of `tutorial_client/src/main.rs` with the following:

```rust
use swimos_client::{BasicValueDownlinkLifecycle, DownlinkConfig, RemotePath, SwimClientBuilder};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Build a Swim Client using the default configuration.
    // The `build` method returns a `SwimClient` instance and its internal
    // runtime future that is spawned below.
    let (client, task) = SwimClientBuilder::default().build().await;
    let _client_task = tokio::spawn(task);
    let handle = client.handle();

    // Build a path the downlink.
    let state_path = RemotePath::new(
        // The host address
        "ws://0.0.0.0:8080",
        // You can provide any agent URI that matches the pattern
        // "/example/:id"
        "/example/1",
        // This is the URI of the ValueLane<i32> in our ExampleAgent
        "state",
    );

    let lifecycle = BasicValueDownlinkLifecycle::<usize>::default()
        // Register an event handler that is invoked when the downlink connects to the agent.
        .on_linked_blocking(|| println!("Downlink linked"))
        // Register an event handler that is invoked when the downlink synchronises its state.
        // with the agent.
        .on_synced_blocking(|value| println!("Downlink synced with: {value:?}"))
        // Register an event handler that is invoked when the downlink receives an event.
        .on_event_blocking(|value| println!("Downlink event: {value:?}"));

    // Build our downlink.
    //
    // This operation may fail if there is a connection issue.
    let state_downlink = handle
        .value_downlink::<i32>(state_path)
        .lifecycle(lifecycle)
        .downlink_config(DownlinkConfig::default())
        .open()
        .await
        .expect("Failed to open downlink");

    for i in 0..10 {
        // Update the lane's state.
        state_downlink.set(i).await.expect("Failed to set downlink state");
    }

    tokio::signal::ctrl_c()
        .await
        .expect("Failed to listen for ctrl-c.");
}
```

Now, both of the applications can be run and the client will produce an output. In the `tutorial_server` directory run:

```shell
$ cargo run
```

And in the `tutorial_client` directory run:

```shell
$ cargo run
```

The server will not produce any output but the client will produce:

```
Downlink linked
Downlink synced with: 0
Downlink event: 0
Downlink event: 1
Downlink event: 2
Downlink event: 3
Downlink event: 4
Downlink event: 5
Downlink event: 6
Downlink event: 7
Downlink event: 8
Downlink event: 9
```

Inspecting these events, you can observe an execution flow of `linked -> synced -> events (0 -> 9)`.

When a downlink first connects to a lane, it sends a request to register for events (known as a link request) and it receives back a `linked` response envelope. The same happens for a sync request but before a `synced` response is received, any state from the lane is transmitted to the client. Once the downlink has synced, it will receive events from the lane. Which in the example, is triggered by the client and it's important to note, that state is transmitted to **all** linked registrants.

It's possible to register a lifecycle event which is triggered when the downlink unlinks. This may be useful if you need to fire a subsequent event for when the agent stops (perhaps due to a timeout) or the server stops. It is also possible to create lifecycle event handlers that execute asynchronously or share state which is provided to the closure as an argument.

# Agent Lifecycle

Agent lifecycles provide the ability to build powerful, stateful, streaming data applications and they are where you will spend most of your time when writing SwimOS server applications. Inside an agent lifecycle implementation, a number of event handlers may be registered which are invoked at various stages within the lifecycle. There are three types of lifecycle event handlers:

- The `on_start` handler: invoked exactly once when the agent has started. This handler may be useful if you need an agent to start polling an API once the agent has started.
- The `on_stop` handler: invoked exactly once just before the agent stops. This handler may be useful to clear up some resources before an agent stops.
- Lane-specific event handlers which are invoked when a lane receives an event. For example, for a `ValueLane` you may register a handler that is invoked after the state of the lane has changed. These handlers allow your agent to _react_ to the events that it receives and to trigger updates elsewhere.

There is no requirement for any handlers to be registered and you could just have a stateful representation of your streaming data. However, handlers provide the functionality to be notified of certain events that happen during the lifecycle of an agent.

Handlers are added to the implementation of the agent's lifecycle. For example, to attach `on_start` and `on_stop` handlers:

```rust
use swim::agent::{lifecycle, agent_lifecycle::utility::HandlerContext, event_handler::EventHandler};

#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct ExampleLifecycle;

#[lifecycle(ExampleAgent)]
impl ExampleLifecycle {
    #[on_start]
    pub fn on_start(
        &self,
        context: HandlerContext<ExampleAgent>,
    ) -> impl EventHandler<ExampleAgent> {
        context.effect(|| println!("Starting agent."))
    }

    #[on_stop]
    pub fn on_stop(
        &self,
        context: HandlerContext<ExampleAgent>,
    ) -> impl EventHandler<ExampleAgent> {
        context.effect(|| println!("Stopping agent."))
    }
}
```

Each lifecycle event handler accepts a `HandlerContext` (which aids in the creation of `EventHandlers`) and returns an `EventHandler` which is scoped to the agent that the lifecycle is bound to; this allows the handler to interact with the lanes within the agent. An `EventHandler` models an action that happens within an agent after an event is triggered; such as an agent starting or an event was received. They may not return a value but may trigger an event to happen elsewhere within an agent, such as updating the state of a lane or running an async task; these handlers are created using the provided `HandlerContext`.

Event handlers are modelled as state machines and their execution closely resembles an implementation of the `Future` trait. A lane event handler may trigger the state of another lane to change and as a result, its event handler will also be executed. These events happen sequentially and the first handler will not complete until its handler's dependency chain has been executed. This ensures that event obserability is maintained and the first handler will correctly view the state of the lanes that it has mutated.

# Registering a value lane event handler

To register an event handler for `ExampleAgent`'s value lane, the function would be:

```rust
#[on_event(lane)]
pub fn on_event(
    &self,
    context: HandlerContext<ExampleAgent>,
    value: &i32,
) -> impl EventHandler<ExampleAgent> {
    // Build and return an EventHandler.
    //
    // It is in these implementations where your application logic will reside.
}
```

Going over the implementation:

- `#[on_event(lane)]`: `on_event` is an event handler specific to value lanes and its argument is the name of the field in the `ExampleAgent` struct.
- `context`: handler context scoped to the agent.
- `value`: reference to the new state of the lane.
- `-> impl EventHandler<ExampleAgent>`: the side effect that you want this event to have. Here you could set the state of another lane or update a database.

Replace the lifecycle implementation with the following:

```rust
#[lifecycle(ExampleAgent)]
impl ExampleLifecycle {
    // Handler invoked when the agent starts.
    #[on_start]
    pub fn on_start(
        &self,
        context: HandlerContext<ExampleAgent>,
    ) -> impl EventHandler<ExampleAgent> {
        context.effect(|| println!("Starting agent."))
    }

    // Handler invoked when the agent is about to stop.
    #[on_stop]
    pub fn on_stop(
        &self,
        context: HandlerContext<ExampleAgent>,
    ) -> impl EventHandler<ExampleAgent> {
        context.effect(|| println!("Stopping agent."))
    }

    // Handler invoked after the state of 'lane' has changed.
    #[on_event(state)]
    pub fn on_event(
        &self,
        context: HandlerContext<ExampleAgent>,
        value: &i32,
    ) -> impl EventHandler<ExampleAgent> {
        let n = *value;
        // EventHandler::effect accepts a FnOnce()
        // which runs a side effect.
        context.effect(move || {
            println!("Setting value to: {}", n);
        })
    }
}
```

# Running the application

Now that both the client and server applications have been built they can be run and both will produce outputs.

In the `tutorial_server` directory run:

```shell
$ cargo run
```

And in the `tutorial_client` directory run:

```shell
$ cargo run
```

The client application will produce:

```
Downlink linked
Downlink synced with: 0
Downlink event: 0
Downlink event: 1
Downlink event: 2
Downlink event: 3
Downlink event: 4
Downlink event: 5
Downlink event: 6
Downlink event: 7
Downlink event: 8
Downlink event: 9
```

And the server will produce:

```
Starting agent.
Setting value to: 0
Setting value to: 1
Setting value to: 2
Setting value to: 3
Setting value to: 4
Setting value to: 5
Setting value to: 6
Setting value to: 7
Setting value to: 8
Setting value to: 9
```

After the agent timeout period has elapsed you will observe a message that the agent is stopping too:

```
Stopping agent.
```

# Expanding

The server will continue listening for events indefinately, starting and stopping the agents as required. Feel free to play around with what has been put together to get familar with what has been covered. You could:

- Add more `ValueLane`s that contain different types and push events using the client application.
- Read through the [`HandlerContext`](https://docs.rs/swimos/latest/swimos/agent/agent_lifecycle/utility/struct.HandlerContext.html) and [`EventHandler`](https://docs.rs/swimos/latest/swimos/agent/agent_lifecycle/event_handler/trait.EventHandler.html) reference documentation and expand the event handlers.
- Push events externally (perhaps to a database) using the existing event handler for the lane.

If you've had any issues then feel free to reach out for help over at the SwimOS Rust GitHub [repository](https://github.com/swimos/swim-rust/).

The next section in this developer guide will cover using custom types.
