To initiate the setup of a SwimOS project, start by creating and navigating to the directory where it will be located. First, lets start by creating a new server project named `tutorial_server`:

```shell
$ cargo new tutorial_server --bin
```

Then we need to declare our dependencies. Let's start by adding the following to our `tutorial_server/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
swimos = "{{ site.data.rust.swimos-version }}"
tokio = { "{{ site.data.rust.tokio-version }}", features = ["full"] }
```

The SwimOS platform is built using the `tokio` runtime so we need to include it.

The Minimum Supported Rust Version is {{ site.data.rust.rustc-version }}
