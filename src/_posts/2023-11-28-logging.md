# Understanding the Swim logging API

The public interface for logging, <a href="swim-java/swim-runtime/swim-core/swim.util/src/main/java/swim/util/Log.java" target="_blank">`swim.util.Log`</a> defines six methods, all of which return `void` and take single parameter of type `Objecct`. Here is an example:

```
  void trace(Object message);
```

The supported methods, from lowest to high, are:

- trace: Logs a trace-level message.
- debug: Logs a debug-level message.
- info: Logs an info-level message.
- warn: Logs a warn-level message.
- error: Logs an error-level message.
- fail: Logs an fail-level message.

This interface can be found on several classes, such as `AbstractPlane`, `AbstractAgent`, and all of the lane types, such as `CommandLane`, `ValueLane`, and `MapLane`. Implementation-wise, they will ultimately print the message passed down, so additional enhancement to show context such as agent, host, node, and lane can be accomplished using a wrapper within your Web Agent implementation.

Invoking a log method within a Web Agent method might look like this:

```
info("SpecialAgent initialized for " + nodeUri());
```
